There must be more pressure on Russia to stop this terror. And that depends on all our partners\u2014the U.S., Europe, and others around the world. After the last meeting in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, it has become absolutely clear to the entire world: Russia is the only one dragging this war out, the only one that brought it here\u2014and the only one who needs it to continue.  Since March 11, a proposal for an unconditional ceasefire has been on the table\u2014and these attacks could have already stopped. But it is Russia that continues all this. Every night, every single day, it carries out the most cynical strikes. Without pressure on Russia, those in Moscow will continue to show contempt for real diplomacy and keep destroying lives.  Today is the second meeting between the Ukrainian and U.S. teams in Saudi Arabia. This time at a more technical level\u2014with our military, diplomats, and representatives from the Ministry of Energy.

When this all began, I was only 21 years old\u2014a college student with dreams like anyone else. For past 18 months, I have dedicated every moment of my life to my people. I documented the horrors in northern Gaza minute by minute, determined to show the world the truth they tried to bury. I slept on pavements, in schools, in tents\u2014anywhere I could. Each day was a battle for survival. I endured hunger for months, yet I never left my people\u2019s side. By God, I fulfilled my duty as a journalist. I risked everything to report the truth, and now, I am finally at rest\u2014something I haven\u2019t known in the past 18 months . I did all this because I believe in the Palestinian cause. I believe this land is ours, and it has been the highest honor of my life to die defending it and serving its people. I ask you now: do not stop speaking about Gaza. Do not let the world look away. Keep fighting, keep telling our stories\u2014until Palestine is free.\u201d \u2014 For the last time, Hossam Shabat, from northern Gaza.\u201d",

    "text":"\ud83d\udd0dWho is Michael Anton, the lead negotiator sent by Trump to talk peace with Russia?  The world is holding its breath awaiting news on the outcome of a new round of Russia-US talks in Riyadh on Ukraine. Leading the US delegation this time around is a former Trump speechwriter whose significance has been completely overlooked by the mainstream media.  \ud83d\udd34 Michael Anton, policy planning director at the State Department, is the chief ideologist behind \u201cAmerica First\u201d \u2013 the keystone Trump domestic and foreign policy concept unveiled in 2016, which prioritizes American interests over globalism.  \ud83d\udd34 In his influential 2016 essay \u201cThe Flight 93 Election,\u201d Anton argued that Trump was America\u2019s last chance to preserve America\u2019s identity, borders and sovereignty against a liberal elite driving the country toward disaster.  \ud83d\udd34 A paleoconservative, Anton has been a consistent critic of hawks in both parties. In a 2022 essay on George Kennan, he blasted \u201cRussophobic Kennanphiles\u2019\u201d stubborn rejection of talking to Russia, and pointed out that Kennan rightfully \u201cpredicted that pushing\u2019s NATO\u2019s border to the Ukrainian frontier would spark a crisis.\u201d  \ud83d\udd34 Elsewhere, Anton has expressed skepticism of US involvement in the conflict, stressing that the US is not world\u2019s policeman, has no direct national security interests in Ukraine, and warning that the quagmire would sap US military power and leave it falling behind in the competition with China.  \ud83d\udd34 Anton has said that Russia was provoked in Ukraine, and has expressed fears that the crisis could lead to a wider war (a concern Trump himself has regularly voiced).  \ud83d\udd34 In a 2023 speech, Anton urged conservative forces in the US and Britain to adopt to a new \u201cgrand strategy\u201d for the 21st century \u2013 waging fewer wars and paying more attention to domestic problems, like borders and the economy.  \ud83d\udd34 Today, his central role in Riyadh may signal that the pragmatists in Trump\u2019s administration favoring a big reset with Russia have consolidated their positions in Washington.",

Just hours before his assassination, he was mourning the martyrdom of fellow journalist Mohammed Mansour, who was also killed in an airstrike by IOF.  At the age of 7, Hossam witnessed israel\u2019s ground invasion of Gaza, in which the zionist entity killed 1,400 Palestinians. By 10, he endured a brutal airstrike campaign. At 11, another ground invasion took place, killing 2,200 people. When he was 19, he lived through yet another devastating bombing campaign. And by 22, he saw the onset of the ongoing genocide. Hossam was only 23 years old as he was murdered today.   Since October 7th 2023, the occupation has murdered over 210 journalists in its attempt to silence those bearing witness to its crimes. But their voices will not be erased. Hossam\u2019s legacy, like that of every martyred journalist, lives on in the truth they so bravely fought to expose.\ud83c\uddf5\ud83c\uddf8",

    "text":"And Agenda Being Played Under The Table: A Full Deck In One Sleeve So if Israel killed John F. Kennedy because he was in the way of Israel getting nuclear weapons. 3rd temple? Donald Trump is sending money to Israel. Leash? But Donald Trump wants to put sanctions on ICC. Legal foothold for criminal trial? And Donald Trump wants Israel to destroy Iran\u2019s nuclear facility. Catch 22? But Israel wanted to continue the war in Gaza. Trade route? So Donald Trump announced the US is taking over. Strategic outpost? What is the ultimate goal? The JFK Files: Israel\u2019s Shadow in the Assassination The newly released JFK files from the National Archives 104-10337-10001 don\u2019t directly name Israel, but they crack open a door that\u2019s been bolted shut for decades. The files show the CIA had a pre-assassination file on Lee Harvey Oswald 33 documents, 110 pages, with only 11 from the CIA itself. That\u2019s a slim dossier for a guy pegged as a lone gunman, and it\u2019s got FBI, State Department, and Navy fingerprints all over it. The kicker? The files reveal a disorganized mess of 250,000-300,000 pages, unindexed, with gaps that scream \u201cmissing pieces.\u201d Then there\u2019s 104-10433-10209, which talks about the FBI and CIA restricting research, withholding data from the Warren Commission, and the Justice Department sitting on test results nobody else has seen. This ain\u2019t just sloppy it\u2019s a neon sign pointing to a cover-up. Now, let\u2019s connect the dots to Israel. JFK was a roadblock to Israel\u2019s nuclear ambitions historical records show he pushed hard for inspections of Israel\u2019s Dimona reactor in 1963, threatening to cut aid if they didn\u2019t comply. By November 22, 1963, he was gone, and LBJ, who was way friendlier to Israel, took over. Dimona went online, unchecked, by 1967. The files don\u2019t spell it out, but the timing, the gaps, and the CIA\u2019s focus on Oswald\u2019s Mexico City trip where he met folks like Silvia Duran and Valeriy Kostikov 104-10332-10022 hint at foreign players. Mexico City was a hub for anti-Castro ops, but also a spot where Israeli intelligence, via Mossad, could\u2019ve crossed paths with CIA assets. If Israel had a hand in JFK\u2019s death to secure their nuclear program and the 3rd Temple dream tied to their eschatological goals Trump releasing these files isn\u2019t a love letter to Israel. It\u2019s a warning shot. Money to Israel: The Leash Trump\u2019s sending funds to Israel, sure, but it\u2019s not charity it\u2019s control. Israel\u2019s military machine leans hard on U.S. aid $3.8 billion a year, plus extra billions in 2025 for Iron Dome upgrades. That cash comes with strings: Israel has to buy American weapons, keep U.S. contractors fat, and play ball on regional strategy. Trump\u2019s got Netanyahu on a leash, not the other way around. Sanctions on the ICC: Legal Foothold Trump\u2019s push to sanction the ICC isn\u2019t about protecting Israel it\u2019s about protecting his leverage. The ICC has warrants out for Netanyahu over Gaza war crimes, and if that trial happens in The Hague, Trump loses control. By sanctioning the ICC and pushing for any trial to happen in the U.S., he\u2019s ensuring America calls the shots. If Netanyahu\u2019s tried on U.S. soil, Trump can dangle a pardon or a conviction as a bargaining chip. That\u2019s power, not loyalty. Israel and Iran\u2019s Nuclear Sites: The Catch-22 Trump\u2019s greenlighting Israel to hit Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities, but it\u2019s a double-edged sword. Iran\u2019s program threatens Israel, sure, but a strike risks a wider war dragging the U.S. in. Trump knows Israel can\u2019t do it alone; they\u2019d need American intel, refueling, and maybe boots on the ground. By pushing this, Trump\u2019s forcing Israel into a corner: act and risk chaos, or stall and look weak. Either way, Trump wins Iran\u2019s crippled, or Israel\u2019s exposed as dependent. Gaza War and Trade Routes: Strategic Outpost Israel\u2019s been itching to control Gaza for decades not just for security, but for the Ben Gurion Canal project, a trade route to rival Suez. Gaza\u2019s coast is prime real estate. Trump announcing U.S. takeover of Gaza in 2025 isn\u2019t him handing it to Israel it\u2019s him snatching it for America. U.S. troops in Gaza mean a strategic outpost in the Middle East, a chokehold on shipping lanes, and a base to counter Iran, Russia, and China\u2019s regional plays. Israel wanted Gaza; Trump took it. The Ultimate Goal: American Dominance, Not Israeli Supremacy Trump\u2019s endgame isn\u2019t yielding to Israel as a superpower it\u2019s cementing American dominance while keeping Israel as a useful, but leashed, attack dog. He\u2019s not Netanyahu\u2019s pawn; Netanyahu\u2019s his. Here\u2019s Why: The JFK Files as Leverage: If Trump was Israel\u2019s lapdog, he\u2019d have buried those files, not released them. By letting them out, he\u2019s signaling to Netanyahu: \u201cI know what you did, and I can make it worse.\u201d That\u2019s a power move Trump\u2019s holding a historical bombshell over Israel\u2019s head, ensuring they stay in line. Gaza as a Chess Piece: Taking Gaza isn\u2019t a gift to Israel it\u2019s a middle finger. Israel\u2019s spent years bleeding for that strip, and Trump just swooped in, planting the Stars and Stripes. Now he controls the trade route, the narrative, and the regional power balance. Netanyahu\u2019s Trap: With the ICC sanctions, Trump\u2019s boxed Netanyahu in. If Bibi\u2019s tried in the U.S., Trump decides his fate. If Israel balks at Trump\u2019s Iran demands, those JFK files could get a louder megaphone maybe with more declassified dirt on Mossad\u2019s 1963 moves. Will Benjamin Netanyahu ever be tried in the US? Israel is responsible for The USS Liberty attack. Israel is responsible for 9\/11 What happens when Donald Trump releases those files which also implicate Benjamin Netanyahu? The International Criminal Court (ICC) issued arrest warrants for Netanyahu in November 2024 over war crimes in Gaza specifically for starvation as a weapon and civilian attacks. Trump\u2019s 2025 push to sanction the ICC, as you noted, is a power move to pull any trial into U.S. jurisdiction. If Netanyahu\u2019s tried in the U.S., Trump controls the outcome conviction, pardon, or a deal. It\u2019s possible, legally, because the U.S. can prosecute foreign leaders for crimes impacting American interests, especially if tied to events like 9\/11 or the USS Liberty. The Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act has exceptions for terrorism, and the Anti-Terrorism Act lets U.S. victims sue foreign actors. Netanyahu\u2019s not immune if the evidence sticks. What is being set up to get us there is the question?",

All of this weaponry contains at least 102,000 foreign components. That\u2019s why sanctions against Russian terrorists must be more effective. Every loophole that allows them to bypass the sanctions regime must be eliminated.  New decisions and new pressure on Moscow are needed to bring an end to these strikes and this war.

Ces discussions font suite \u00e0 une rencontre entre d\u00e9l\u00e9gations ukrainienne et am\u00e9ricaine le 23 mars \u00e0 Riyad, qualifi\u00e9e de \u00ab productive \u00bb par le ministre ukrainien de la D\u00e9fense, Rustem Umerov. Les \u00e9changes ont port\u00e9 sur des aspects cl\u00e9s comme la protection des infrastructures \u00e9nerg\u00e9tiques. Le conseiller \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 nationale am\u00e9ricain, Michael Waltz, a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que les parties \u00e9taient \u00ab plus proches que jamais de la paix \u00bb, bien que le Kremlin ait anticip\u00e9 des discussions \u00ab difficiles \u00bb.  -Les n\u00e9gociations en Arabie saoudite s\u2019inscrivent dans une s\u00e9rie d\u2019efforts diplomatiques, avec le royaume jouant un r\u00f4le de m\u00e9diateur. Des avanc\u00e9es ant\u00e9rieures, comme la rencontre russo-am\u00e9ricaine du 17 f\u00e9vrier 2025 \u00e0 Riyad, avaient pos\u00e9 les bases d\u2019une coop\u00e9ration future, bien que l\u2019Ukraine ait insist\u00e9 pour \u00eatre pleinement incluse dans tout processus d\u00e9cisionnel.   La Russie a exprim\u00e9 des r\u00e9serves, notamment sur un \u00e9ventuel d\u00e9ploiement de troupes occidentales en Ukraine post-accord, et a mis l\u2019accent sur des enjeux comme la reprise de l\u2019accord c\u00e9r\u00e9alier en mer Noire.  En r\u00e9sum\u00e9, les pourparlers progressent avec un cessez-le-feu de 30 jours propos\u00e9 et soutenu par l\u2019Ukraine et les \u00c9tats-Unis, mais l\u2019acceptation par la Russie reste incertaine, pas pr\u00eate \u00e0 une tr\u00eave qui permettrait une r\u00e9armement strat\u00e9gique facilit\u00e9 par le trio Starmer\/Macron\/Merz  Les discussions russo-am\u00e9ricaines en cours aujourd\u2019hui \u00e0 Riyad pourraient donc apporter des clarifications suppl\u00e9mentaires dans les prochaines heures ou jours. La situation \u00e9volue rapidement, et les r\u00e9sultats d\u00e9pendront largement et logiquement de la position russe face \u00e0 ces propositions par une guerre par procuration initi\u00e9e par les d\u00e9mocrates US sur un territoire occup\u00e9 et rachet\u00e9 par les multinationales Blackrock ou le milliardaire Bill Gates",

    "text":"How many Russian nukes to wipe Britain of the face of the map Determining the exact number of Russian nuclear weapons required to \"wipe Britain off the face of the map\" involves complex variables, including the yield of the warheads, their delivery systems, targeting strategy, and the definition of \"wipe off.\" However, I can provide an informed estimate based on available data about Russia's nuclear arsenal and the potential effects of nuclear detonations. Russia possesses approximately 5,580 nuclear warheads as of 2024, with around 1,710 deployed strategic warheads capable of reaching distant targets like the UK via intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs), and heavy bombers. The yield of these weapons varies widely, from tactical warheads with yields as low as 5-50 kilotons to strategic warheads like those on the RS-28 Sarmat (NATO: Satan 2), which can carry multiple warheads with yields potentially exceeding 1 megaton each. Britain\u2019s land area is about 243,610 square kilometers, with a population of roughly 67 million, concentrated in urban centers like London, Birmingham, and Manchester. A single high-yield nuclear detonation, such as an 800-kiloton warhead (a common estimate for Russian strategic weapons), could devastate a major city. For example, if detonated over London, it could cause a fireball radius of about 1 kilometer, a thermal radiation radius of 10-12 kilometers (causing third-degree burns), and a blast radius of 5-7 kilometers, potentially killing millions and leveling infrastructure. The fallout would further extend the damage, depending on wind patterns. To achieve total destruction\u2014meaning the annihilation of all major population centers, infrastructure, and habitable land\u2014multiple warheads would be needed. A rough estimate can be derived from historical nuclear planning concepts like \"overkill\" and the effects of large-yield weapons. The Soviet-era Tsar Bomba (50 megatons, tested in 1961) had a blast radius of about 35 kilometers and could theoretically destroy an area of over 3,000 square kilometers in a single detonation. Modern Russian weapons, while not as large, are more numerous and can be equipped with multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles (MIRVs). Assuming a goal of destroying the UK\u2019s 20 largest urban areas (which house over 50% of the population) and key military and industrial sites, a conservative estimate might involve 20-30 warheads of 800 kilotons to 1 megaton each. This would ensure overlapping blast zones, widespread fallout, and the collapse of societal function. However, if Russia deployed a smaller number of higher-yield weapons (e.g., 5-10 megatons, though less common today), as few as 5-10 could theoretically suffice to render the UK uninhabitable by targeting key regions and maximizing fallout. In practice, Russia\u2019s strategy might not require total physical destruction. A smaller number\u2014say, 3-5 warheads\u2014targeting London, Birmingham, and northern industrial hubs like Manchester or Glasgow could cripple the UK\u2019s government, economy, and population, effectively \"wiping it off the map\" as a functioning state. Posts on X suggest a similar sentiment, with users estimating that 3 well-placed warheads could obliterate the UK due to its small size and concentrated population, though these lack detailed analysis. Realistically, the number depends on intent: total annihilation might take 20-30 warheads, while strategic collapse could occur with 3-5. Russia has the capability to deliver far more than needed, but factors like missile defense (e.g., NATO systems) and retaliatory strikes from the UK\u2019s Trident submarines would complicate any such scenario. This is a hypothetical exercise\u2014nuclear doctrine prioritizes deterrence, not execution, and the consequences would extend globally, rendering the question more academic than practical. thank squire You\u2019re welcome, mate!

In Kyiv, the attack claimed three lives, among them a father and his five-year-old daughter. Yesterday in Zaporizhzhia, three people were killed\u2014a family: father, mother, and their 17-year-old daughter. My condolences to the families and loved ones.  These attacks are a daily reality. This week alone, over 1,580 guided aerial bombs, nearly 1,100 strike drones, and 15 missiles of various types were used against our people. All of this weaponry contains at least 102,000 foreign components. That\u2019s why sanctions against Russian terrorists must be more effective. Every loophole that allows them to bypass the sanctions regime must be eliminated.  New decisions and new pressure on Moscow are needed to bring an end to these strikes and this war.  We must strengthen Ukraine and our army \u2013 with more air defense systems and real support. I thank all partners who understand this and continue to support Ukraine.",

Ces discussions font suite \u00e0 une rencontre entre d\u00e9l\u00e9gations ukrainienne et am\u00e9ricaine le 23 mars \u00e0 Riyad, qualifi\u00e9e de \u00ab productive \u00bb par le ministre ukrainien de la D\u00e9fense, Rustem Umerov. Les \u00e9changes ont port\u00e9 sur des aspects cl\u00e9s comme la protection des infrastructures \u00e9nerg\u00e9tiques. Le conseiller \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 nationale am\u00e9ricain, Michael Waltz, a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que les parties \u00e9taient \u00ab plus proches que jamais de la paix \u00bb, bien que le Kremlin ait anticip\u00e9 des discussions \u00ab difficiles \u00bb.  -Les n\u00e9gociations en Arabie saoudite s\u2019inscrivent dans une s\u00e9rie d\u2019efforts diplomatiques, avec le royaume jouant un r\u00f4le de m\u00e9diateur. Des avanc\u00e9es ant\u00e9rieures, comme la rencontre russo-am\u00e9ricaine du 17 f\u00e9vrier 2025 \u00e0 Riyad, avaient pos\u00e9 les bases d\u2019une coop\u00e9ration future, bien que l\u2019Ukraine ait insist\u00e9 pour \u00eatre pleinement incluse dans tout processus d\u00e9cisionnel.   La Russie a exprim\u00e9 des r\u00e9serves, notamment sur un \u00e9ventuel d\u00e9ploiement de troupes occidentales en Ukraine post-accord, et a mis l\u2019accent sur des enjeux comme la reprise de l\u2019accord c\u00e9r\u00e9alier en mer Noire.  En r\u00e9sum\u00e9, les pourparlers progressent avec un cessez-le-feu de 30 jours propos\u00e9 et soutenu par l\u2019Ukraine et les \u00c9tats-Unis, mais l\u2019acceptation par la Russie reste incertaine, pas pr\u00eate \u00e0 une tr\u00eave qui permettrait une r\u00e9armement strat\u00e9gique facilit\u00e9 par le trio Starmer\/Macron\/Merz  Les discussions russo-am\u00e9ricaines en cours aujourd\u2019hui \u00e0 Riyad pourraient donc apporter des clarifications suppl\u00e9mentaires dans les prochaines heures ou jours. La situation \u00e9volue rapidement, et les r\u00e9sultats d\u00e9pendront largement et logiquement de la position russe face \u00e0 ces propositions par une guerre par procuration initi\u00e9e par les d\u00e9mocrates US sur un territoire occup\u00e9 et rachet\u00e9 par les multinationales Blackrock ou le milliardaire Bill Gates",

In other words, the key figures in charge of defense, diplomacy and decision-making.  The U.S. delegation. Andrew Peake, former official of the National Security Council during Trump's first term, Michael Anton - ideologue of the \"new right-wing revenge\", publicist, philosopher and former BlackRock employee, and Trump's special envoy Keith Kellogg.  Russian delegation. The formal head is Grigory Karasin, chairman of the Federation Council Committee on International Affairs. In reality - a retired bureaucrat, long ago put out of brackets. But the number two is Sergey Beseda, advisor to the FSB director. The very same Beseda who oversaw Russian special operations in Ukraine before and after February 24.

When this all began, I was only 21 years old, a college student with dreams like anyone else. For the past 18 months, I have dedicated every moment of my life to my people. I documented the horrors in northern Gaza minute by minute, determined to show the world the truth they tried to bury. I slept on pavements, in schools, in tents, anywhere I could. Each day was a battle for survival. I endured hunger for months, yet I never left my people\u2019s side. By God, I fulfilled my duty as a journalist. I risked everything to report the truth, and now, I am finally at rest. Something I haven\u2019t known in the past 18 months . I did all this because I believe in the Palestinian cause. I believe this land is ours, and it has been the highest honour of my life to die defending it and serving its people. I ask you now: do not stop speaking about Gaza. Do not let the world look away. Keep fighting, keep telling our stories... Until Palestine is free.\u201d For the last time, Hossam Shabat, from northern Gaza.\u201d",

Its roughly 57,000 residents get citizenship. 3. There will not be restrictions placed as to the number of Inuit citizens from Alaska, Greenland, or Canada who can inhabit Greenland. 4.

These are the \"targets\" that the enemy has been hitting all these years. Our children, our future, our homes. Where there should have been family warmth, there is now only pain.
