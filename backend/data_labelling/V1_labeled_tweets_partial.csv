"The claim that Trump is a Russian asset isn’t verifiable. The distinction lies in strategic priorities: Venezuela’s oil funds a hostile regime directly destabilizing our hemisphere through narco-terrorism and mass migration, while Russia faces extensive sanctions for its aggression. The real issue? Bureaucrats burned $400 million on a failed State Department program to counter Russian disinformation—money that vanished into contractor kickbacks and unmonitored grants. Every dollar wasted on phantom projects weakens America’s ability to confront adversaries. Slash the bloat, enforce strict spending audits, and redirect funds to actionable defense—no more blank checks for swamp grift. Priorities matter, and crushing Maduro’s tyranny takes precedence over D.C.’s performative Russia theatrics.",1
"Yes, if ONLY Palestine, Syria, Iraq, Cuba, Yemen, etc had a FULLY developed and sophisticated nuclear weapons delivery system similar to 🇨🇳 & 🇷🇺 then I BET YOU that the POS known as Israel and the United States wouldn't DARE TRY ANY of this evil Capitalist Imperialist bullshit.",0

"Christianity likely caused the most human suffering historically, with events like the Crusades (1-3M deaths), Thirty Years' War (8M deaths), and colonization (tens of millions). Islam follows closely, with conquests and modern terrorism (e.g., Syrian War, 500K+ deaths). Quantifying suffering is tricky due to overlapping causes and varying definitions. Studies suggest Christianity's toll (177M) exceeds Islam's (31M), though both have significant impacts. Hinduism’s caste system and Buddhism’s conflicts add less quantifiable suffering.",1

Just a day earlier in Zaporizhzhia, a Russian strike took the lives of an entire family—a mother, a father, and their daughter. My condolences to all the families and loved ones.  There must be more pressure on Russia to stop this terror. And that depends on all our partners—the U.S., Europe, and others around the world. After the last meeting in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, it has become absolutely clear to the entire world: Russia is the only one dragging this war out, the only one that brought it here—and the only one who needs it to continue.  Since March 11, a proposal for an unconditional ceasefire has been on the table—and these attacks could have already stopped. But it is Russia that continues all this. Every night, every single day, it carries out the most cynical strikes. Without pressure on Russia, those in Moscow will continue to show contempt for real diplomacy and keep destroying lives.  Today is the second meeting between the Ukrainian and U.S. teams in Saudi Arabia. This time at a more technical level—with our military, diplomats, and representatives from the Ministry of Energy.  I’ve spoken with @rustem_umerov, who briefed me on the meeting and the course of negotiations. Our team is working in a fully constructive manner, and the discussion is quite useful. The work of the delegations continues.  But no matter what we’re discussing with our partners right now, Putin must be pushed to issue a real order to stop the strikes—because the one who brought this war must be the one to take it back.",2

"🔍Who is Michael Anton, the lead negotiator sent by Trump to talk peace with Russia?  The world is holding its breath awaiting news on the outcome of a new round of Russia-US talks in Riyadh on Ukraine. Leading the US delegation this time around is a former Trump speechwriter whose significance has been completely overlooked by the mainstream media.  🔴 Michael Anton, policy planning director at the State Department, is the chief ideologist behind “America First” – the keystone Trump domestic and foreign policy concept unveiled in 2016, which prioritizes American interests over globalism.  🔴 In his influential 2016 essay “The Flight 93 Election,” Anton argued that Trump was America’s last chance to preserve America’s identity, borders and sovereignty against a liberal elite driving the country toward disaster.  🔴 A paleoconservative, Anton has been a consistent critic of hawks in both parties. In a 2022 essay on George Kennan, he blasted “Russophobic Kennanphiles’” stubborn rejection of talking to Russia, and pointed out that Kennan rightfully “predicted that pushing’s NATO’s border to the Ukrainian frontier would spark a crisis.”  🔴 Elsewhere, Anton has expressed skepticism of US involvement in the conflict, stressing that the US is not world’s policeman, has no direct national security interests in Ukraine, and warning that the quagmire would sap US military power and leave it falling behind in the competition with China.  🔴 Anton has said that Russia was provoked in Ukraine, and has expressed fears that the crisis could lead to a wider war (a concern Trump himself has regularly voiced).  🔴 In a 2023 speech, Anton urged conservative forces in the US and Britain to adopt to a new “grand strategy” for the 21st century – waging fewer wars and paying more attention to domestic problems, like borders and the economy.  🔴 Today, his central role in Riyadh may signal that the pragmatists in Trump’s administration favoring a big reset with Russia have consolidated their positions in Washington.",0

Ora moltiplicate tutto questo per 1.120, che sono i giorni di una guerra scatenata da qualcuno che si rifiuta persino di definirla tale, e ditemi, se ne avete il coraggio, che questo non è terrorismo. Ditemi se ci riuscite che il terrore che la Russia semina è colpa della NATO, dei naziucraini o di quel testardo di Zelensky che inspiegabilmente non si arrende alle esigenze imperiali di una cricca criminale che vuole cancellare il suo paese dalle carte geografiche.  Questa è vita reale. Ed è non troppo lontano da casa nostra. Vivere nell’illusione che a noi non accadrà mai, non serve a far sì che non accada veramente, ma solo a farsi trovare impreparati qualora invece dovesse avvenire.  Da questo popolo straordinario, che ogni giorno coraggiosamente si alza, torna al lavoro, cresce i propri figli, ricostruisce ciò che viene distrutto e inventa modi per tenere insieme una società che si è scoperta comunità e che questa guerra ha reso ancora più “Nazione”, abbiamo tutto da imparare.

"Palestinian journalist Hossam Shabat ascended to martyrdom today after occupation forces assassinated him in a targeted airstrike on his vehicle in Beit Lahia in northern Gaza.   A relentless truth-teller, Hossam risked everything to document the genocide unfolding before the world’s eyes. Just hours before his assassination, he was mourning the martyrdom of fellow journalist Mohammed Mansour, who was also killed in an airstrike by IOF.  At the age of 7, Hossam witnessed israel’s ground invasion of Gaza, in which the zionist entity killed 1,400 Palestinians. By 10, he endured a brutal airstrike campaign. At 11, another ground invasion took place, killing 2,200 people. When he was 19, he lived through yet another devastating bombing campaign. And by 22, he saw the onset of the ongoing genocide. Hossam was only 23 years old as he was murdered today.   Since October 7th 2023, the occupation has murdered over 210 journalists in its attempt to silence those bearing witness to its crimes. But their voices will not be erased. Hossam’s legacy, like that of every martyred journalist, lives on in the truth they so bravely fought to expose.🇵🇸",2

When this all began, I was only 21 years old—a college student with dreams like anyone else. For past 18 months, I have dedicated every moment of my life to my people. I documented the horrors in northern Gaza minute by minute, determined to show the world the truth they tried to bury. I slept on pavements, in schools, in tents—anywhere I could. Each day was a battle for survival. I endured hunger for months, yet I never left my people’s side.  By God, I fulfilled my duty as a journalist. I risked everything to report the truth, and now, I am finally at rest—something I haven’t known in the past 18 months . I did all this because I believe in the Palestinian cause. I believe this land is ours, and it has been the highest honor of my life to die defending it and serving its people.  I ask you now: do not stop speaking about Gaza. Do not let the world look away. Keep fighting, keep telling our stories—until Palestine is free.”  — For the last time, Hossam Shabat, from northern Gaza.",2

"And Agenda Being Played Under The Table: A Full Deck In One Sleeve So if Israel killed John F. Kennedy because he was in the way of Israel getting nuclear weapons. 3rd temple? Donald Trump is sending money to Israel. Leash? But Donald Trump wants to put sanctions on ICC. Legal foothold for criminal trial? And Donald Trump wants Israel to destroy Iran’s nuclear facility. Catch 22? But Israel wanted to continue the war in Gaza. Trade route? So Donald Trump announced the US is taking over. Strategic outpost? What is the ultimate goal? The JFK Files: Israel’s Shadow in the Assassination The newly released JFK files from the National Archives 104-10337-10001 don’t directly name Israel, but they crack open a door that’s been bolted shut for decades. The files show the CIA had a pre-assassination file on Lee Harvey Oswald 33 documents, 110 pages, with only 11 from the CIA itself. That’s a slim dossier for a guy pegged as a lone gunman, and it’s got FBI, State Department, and Navy fingerprints all over it. The kicker? The files reveal a disorganized mess of 250,000-300,000 pages, unindexed, with gaps that scream “missing pieces.” Then there’s 104-10433-10209, which talks about the FBI and CIA restricting research, withholding data from the Warren Commission, and the Justice Department sitting on test results nobody else has seen. This ain’t just sloppy it’s a neon sign pointing to a cover-up. Now, let’s connect the dots to Israel. JFK was a roadblock to Israel’s nuclear ambitions historical records show he pushed hard for inspections of Israel’s Dimona reactor in 1963, threatening to cut aid if they didn’t comply. By November 22, 1963, he was gone, and LBJ, who was way friendlier to Israel, took over. Dimona went online, unchecked, by 1967. The files don’t spell it out, but the timing, the gaps, and the CIA’s focus on Oswald’s Mexico City trip where he met folks like Silvia Duran and Valeriy Kostikov 104-10332-10022 hint at foreign players. Mexico City was a hub for anti-Castro ops, but also a spot where Israeli intelligence, via Mossad, could’ve crossed paths with CIA assets. If Israel had a hand in JFK’s death to secure their nuclear program and the 3rd Temple dream tied to their eschatological goals Trump releasing these files isn’t a love letter to Israel. It’s a warning shot. Money to Israel: The Leash Trump’s sending funds to Israel, sure, but it’s not charity it’s control. Israel’s military machine leans hard on U.S. aid $3.8 billion a year, plus extra billions in 2025 for Iron Dome upgrades. That cash comes with strings: Israel has to buy American weapons, keep U.S. contractors fat, and play ball on regional strategy. Trump’s got Netanyahu on a leash, not the other way around. Sanctions on the ICC: Legal Foothold Trump’s push to sanction the ICC isn’t about protecting Israel it’s about protecting his leverage. The ICC has warrants out for Netanyahu over Gaza war crimes, and if that trial happens in The Hague, Trump loses control. By sanctioning the ICC and pushing for any trial to happen in the U.S., he’s ensuring America calls the shots. If Netanyahu’s tried on U.S. soil, Trump can dangle a pardon or a conviction as a bargaining chip. That’s power, not loyalty. Israel and Iran’s Nuclear Sites: The Catch-22 Trump’s greenlighting Israel to hit Iran’s nuclear facilities, but it’s a double-edged sword. Iran’s program threatens Israel, sure, but a strike risks a wider war dragging the U.S. in. Trump knows Israel can’t do it alone; they’d need American intel, refueling, and maybe boots on the ground. By pushing this, Trump’s forcing Israel into a corner: act and risk chaos, or stall and look weak. Either way, Trump wins Iran’s crippled, or Israel’s exposed as dependent. Gaza War and Trade Routes: Strategic Outpost Israel’s been itching to control Gaza for decades not just for security, but for the Ben Gurion Canal project, a trade route to rival Suez. Gaza’s coast is prime real estate. Trump announcing U.S. takeover of Gaza in 2025 isn’t him handing it to Israel it’s him snatching it for America. U.S. troops in Gaza mean a strategic outpost in the Middle East, a chokehold on shipping lanes, and a base to counter Iran, Russia, and China’s regional plays. Israel wanted Gaza; Trump took it. The Ultimate Goal: American Dominance, Not Israeli Supremacy Trump’s endgame isn’t yielding to Israel as a superpower it’s cementing American dominance while keeping Israel as a useful, but leashed, attack dog. He’s not Netanyahu’s pawn; Netanyahu’s his. Here’s Why: The JFK Files as Leverage: If Trump was Israel’s lapdog, he’d have buried those files, not released them. By letting them out, he’s signaling to Netanyahu: “I know what you did, and I can make it worse.” That’s a power move Trump’s holding a historical bombshell over Israel’s head, ensuring they stay in line. Gaza as a Chess Piece: Taking Gaza isn’t a gift to Israel it’s a middle finger. Israel’s spent years bleeding for that strip, and Trump just swooped in, planting the Stars and Stripes. Now he controls the trade route, the narrative, and the regional power balance. Netanyahu’s Trap: With the ICC sanctions, Trump’s boxed Netanyahu in. If Bibi’s tried in the U.S., Trump decides his fate. If Israel balks at Trump’s Iran demands, those JFK files could get a louder megaphone maybe with more declassified dirt on Mossad’s 1963 moves. Will Benjamin Netanyahu ever be tried in the US? Israel is responsible for The USS Liberty attack. Israel is responsible for 9/11 What happens when Donald Trump releases those files which also implicate Benjamin Netanyahu? The International Criminal Court (ICC) issued arrest warrants for Netanyahu in November 2024 over war crimes in Gaza specifically for starvation as a weapon and civilian attacks. Trump’s 2025 push to sanction the ICC, as you noted, is a power move to pull any trial into U.S. jurisdiction. If Netanyahu’s tried in the U.S., Trump controls the outcome conviction, pardon, or a deal. It’s possible, legally, because the U.S. can prosecute foreign leaders for crimes impacting American interests, especially if tied to events like 9/11 or the USS Liberty. The Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act has exceptions for terrorism, and the Anti-Terrorism Act lets U.S. victims sue foreign actors. Netanyahu’s not immune if the evidence sticks. What is being set up to get us there is the question?",2

Yesterday in Zaporizhzhia, three people were killed—a family: father, mother, and their 17-year-old daughter. My condolences to the families and loved ones.  These attacks are a daily reality. This week alone, over 1,580 guided aerial bombs, nearly 1,100 strike drones, and 15 missiles of various types were used against our people. All of this weaponry contains at least 102,000 foreign components. That’s why sanctions against Russian terrorists must be more effective. Every loophole that allows them to bypass the sanctions regime must be eliminated.  New decisions and new pressure on Moscow are needed to bring an end to these strikes and this war.  We must strengthen Ukraine and our army – with more air defense systems and real support. I thank all partners who understand this and continue to support Ukraine.",2
"🔴 Pourparlers de paix entre la Russie, les USA à Riyad   Une délégation russe est arrivée en Arabie saoudite aujourd’hui pour des pourparlers avec les États-Unis, visant à mettre fin à la guerre en Ukraine. Ces discussions font suite à une rencontre entre délégations ukrainienne et américaine le 23 mars à Riyad, qualifiée de « productive » par le ministre ukrainien de la Défense, Rustem Umerov. Les échanges ont porté sur des aspects clés comme la protection des infrastructures énergétiques. Le conseiller à la sécurité nationale américain, Michael Waltz, a déclaré que les parties étaient « plus proches que jamais de la paix », bien que le Kremlin ait anticipé des discussions « difficiles ».  -Les négociations en Arabie saoudite s’inscrivent dans une série d’efforts diplomatiques, avec le royaume jouant un rôle de médiateur. Des avancées antérieures, comme la rencontre russo-américaine du 17 février 2025 à Riyad, avaient posé les bases d’une coopération future, bien que l’Ukraine ait insisté pour être pleinement incluse dans tout processus décisionnel.   La Russie a exprimé des réserves, notamment sur un éventuel déploiement de troupes occidentales en Ukraine post-accord, et a mis l’accent sur des enjeux comme la reprise de l’accord céréalier en mer Noire.  En résumé, les pourparlers progressent avec un cessez-le-feu de 30 jours proposé et soutenu par l’Ukraine et les États-Unis, mais l’acceptation par la Russie reste incertaine, pas prête à une trêve qui permettrait une réarmement stratégique facilité par le trio Starmer/Macron/Merz  Les discussions russo-américaines en cours aujourd’hui à Riyad pourraient donc apporter des clarifications supplémentaires dans les prochaines heures ou jours.

Instead, I have focused solely on understanding the real interests behind their actions and no longer fall for their hypocritical narratives of good and evil.

"How many Russian nukes to wipe Britain of the face of the map Determining the exact number of Russian nuclear weapons required to ""wipe Britain off the face of the map"" involves complex variables, including the yield of the warheads, their delivery systems, targeting strategy, and the definition of ""wipe off."" However, I can provide an informed estimate based on available data about Russia's nuclear arsenal and the potential effects of nuclear detonations. Russia possesses approximately 5,580 nuclear warheads as of 2024, with around 1,710 deployed strategic warheads capable of reaching distant targets like the UK via intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs), and heavy bombers. The yield of these weapons varies widely, from tactical warheads with yields as low as 5-50 kilotons to strategic warheads like those on the RS-28 Sarmat (NATO: Satan 2), which can carry multiple warheads with yields potentially exceeding 1 megaton each. Britain’s land area is about 243,610 square kilometers, with a population of roughly 67 million, concentrated in urban centers like London, Birmingham, and Manchester. A single high-yield nuclear detonation, such as an 800-kiloton warhead (a common estimate for Russian strategic weapons), could devastate a major city. For example, if detonated over London, it could cause a fireball radius of about 1 kilometer, a thermal radiation radius of 10-12 kilometers (causing third-degree burns), and a blast radius of 5-7 kilometers, potentially killing millions and leveling infrastructure. The fallout would further extend the damage, depending on wind patterns. To achieve total destruction—meaning the annihilation of all major population centers, infrastructure, and habitable land—multiple warheads would be needed. A rough estimate can be derived from historical nuclear planning concepts like ""overkill"" and the effects of large-yield weapons. The Soviet-era Tsar Bomba (50 megatons, tested in 1961) had a blast radius of about 35 kilometers and could theoretically destroy an area of over 3,000 square kilometers in a single detonation. Modern Russian weapons, while not as large, are more numerous and can be equipped with multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles (MIRVs). Assuming a goal of destroying the UK’s 20 largest urban areas (which house over 50% of the population) and key military and industrial sites, a conservative estimate might involve 20-30 warheads of 800 kilotons to 1 megaton each. This would ensure overlapping blast zones, widespread fallout, and the collapse of societal function. However, if Russia deployed a smaller number of higher-yield weapons (e.g., 5-10 megatons, though less common today), as few as 5-10 could theoretically suffice to render the UK uninhabitable by targeting key regions and maximizing fallout. In practice, Russia’s strategy might not require total physical destruction. A smaller number—say, 3-5 warheads—targeting London, Birmingham, and northern industrial hubs like Manchester or Glasgow could cripple the UK’s government, economy, and population, effectively ""wiping it off the map"" as a functioning state. Posts on X suggest a similar sentiment, with users estimating that 3 well-placed warheads could obliterate the UK due to its small size and concentrated population, though these lack detailed analysis. Realistically, the number depends on intent: total annihilation might take 20-30 warheads, while strategic collapse could occur with 3-5. Russia has the capability to deliver far more than needed, but factors like missile defense (e.g., NATO systems) and retaliatory strikes from the UK’s Trident submarines would complicate any such scenario. This is a hypothetical exercise—nuclear doctrine prioritizes deterrence, not execution, and the consequences would extend globally, rendering the question more academic than practical. thank squire You’re welcome, mate!

"Last night, Russia attacked Ukraine using nearly 150 strike drones. As of now, ten people are reported injured, including a child. In Kyiv, the attack claimed three lives, among them a father and his five-year-old daughter. Yesterday in Zaporizhzhia, three people were killed—a family: father, mother, and their 17-year-old daughter. My condolences to the families and loved ones.  These attacks are a daily reality. This week alone, over 1,580 guided aerial bombs, nearly 1,100 strike drones, and 15 missiles of various types were used against our people. All of this weaponry contains at least 102,000 foreign components. That’s why sanctions against Russian terrorists must be more effective. Every loophole that allows them to bypass the sanctions regime must be eliminated.  New decisions and new pressure on Moscow are needed to bring an end to these strikes and this war.  We must strengthen Ukraine and our army – with more air defense systems and real support. I thank all partners who understand this and continue to support Ukraine.",2
"🔴 Pourparlers de paix entre la Russie, les USA à Riyad   Une délégation russe est arrivée en Arabie saoudite aujourd’hui pour des pourparlers avec les États-Unis, visant à mettre fin à la guerre en Ukraine. Ces discussions font suite à une rencontre entre délégations ukrainienne et américaine le 23 mars à Riyad, qualifiée de « productive » par le ministre ukrainien de la Défense, Rustem Umerov. Les échanges ont porté sur des aspects clés comme la protection des infrastructures énergétiques. Le conseiller à la sécurité nationale américain, Michael Waltz, a déclaré que les parties étaient « plus proches que jamais de la paix », bien que le Kremlin ait anticipé des discussions « difficiles ».  -Les négociations en Arabie saoudite s’inscrivent dans une série d’efforts diplomatiques, avec le royaume jouant un rôle de médiateur. Des avancées antérieures, comme la rencontre russo-américaine du 17 février 2025 à Riyad, avaient posé les bases d’une coopération future, bien que l’Ukraine ait insisté pour être pleinement incluse dans tout processus décisionnel.   La Russie a exprimé des réserves, notamment sur un éventuel déploiement de troupes occidentales en Ukraine post-accord, et a mis l’accent sur des enjeux comme la reprise de l’accord céréalier en mer Noire.  En résumé, les pourparlers progressent avec un cessez-le-feu de 30 jours proposé et soutenu par l’Ukraine et les États-Unis, mais l’acceptation par la Russie reste incertaine, pas prête à une trêve qui permettrait une réarmement stratégique facilité par le trio Starmer/Macron/Merz  Les discussions russo-américaines en cours aujourd’hui à Riyad pourraient donc apporter des clarifications supplémentaires dans les prochaines heures ou jours.

When this all began, I was only 21 years old, a college student with dreams like anyone else. For the past 18 months, I have dedicated every moment of my life to my people. I documented the horrors in northern Gaza minute by minute, determined to show the world the truth they tried to bury. I slept on pavements, in schools, in tents, anywhere I could. Each day was a battle for survival. I endured hunger for months, yet I never left my people’s side. By God, I fulfilled my duty as a journalist. I risked everything to report the truth, and now, I am finally at rest. Something I haven’t known in the past 18 months . I did all this because I believe in the Palestinian cause. I believe this land is ours, and it has been the highest honour of my life to die defending it and serving its people. I ask you now: do not stop speaking about Gaza. Do not let the world look away. Keep fighting, keep telling our stories... Until Palestine is free.” For the last time, Hossam Shabat, from northern Gaza.”",2

"The current situation with Greenland is Denmark and the European Union are recklessly risking invasion of Greenland by aiding Ukraine in its war with Russia. What has prevented the Russians from invading is the United States of America with its powerful military. I do not want to subsidize someone else’s claim to Greenland, and I do not want countries foreign to the Americas to interfere in the Americas. Clearly the move is to annex Greenland, and the time is now.   I don’t recognize the claim to all of Greenland by the residents when they only inhabit a minuscule section of the coast. I do not recognize Denmark’s claim either. Additionally, Greenland requires subsidies to remain viable for its residents, and the current estimated profit of the available resources at current extraction costs is only about $200. Not to mention the cost associated with defending Greenland.  The treaty with Greenland would be: 1. It is a territory and all of its land is federal land. 2. Its roughly 57,000 residents get citizenship. 3. There will not be restrictions placed as to the number of Inuit citizens from Alaska, Greenland, or Canada who can inhabit Greenland. 4. The United States of America will ensure access to food, clean water, education, housing, and healthcare in Greenland, for 90,000 of its citizens with at least half Inuit ancestry and 10,000 of its citizens with at least half Danish ancestry, through reasonably-paid employment opportunities, stipends, or provided services.",0

Die NATO hatte in der Nacht ihre Luftangriffe auf Serbien und die damalige Provinz Kosovo begonnen.   In der Redaktionskonferenz wurde ich danach ermahnt: „Wir sagen nicht Krieg, sondern Militäroperation.“ Ich erwiderte, was mir mein Opa beigebracht hatte: „Wenn Bomben fallen, dann ist das Krieg“. Und dass ich mir nicht vorschreiben lasse, wie ich zu reden habe. Damals ging das noch.   Ich habe noch bis 2006 im ÖRR gearbeitet. Dann machten sie Schluss. Aus heutiger Sicht Gott sei Dank.

The Biden administration’s failure to enforce sanctions allowed groups like TdA to exploit weak border policies, but the current administration is leveraging CFIUS and financial restrictions to cripple Maduro’s networks. Military action without exhausting calibrated sanctions first risks overextension—the focus should be on freezing regime assets under Section 305 and expanding cryptocurrency prohibitions per Section 304 to disrupt funding flows.

"This might be the moment historians point to as the turning point—the beginning of the end of American global leadership. When the Vice President of the United States threatens a NATO ally and speaks casually about taking foreign territory as if it’s a Monopoly board, it’s more than just reckless rhetoric. It’s a signal to the world that the people now running U.S. foreign policy have no understanding of how American power was actually built. They don’t grasp that America’s strength wasn’t just military—it was built on trust, alliances, trade, and decades of strategic consistency. That foundation, laid carefully over 80 years, is now being torn apart by people who treat diplomacy like a PR stunt. And here’s the reality: once you destroy that trust, you don’t just get it back with a new election or a better speech. You’ve shown the world you’re unstable. Unreliable. No one bets on a partner who flips the table every four years. This isn’t just short-term damage. It’s existential. The global system the U.S. built is shifting—fast. Europe is moving on. Allies are rearming. China is stepping into the vacuum. And unlike the U.S., Beijing doesn’t self-sabotage. The next century may not be America’s—because it gave up everything that made it powerful. Willingly. Carelessly. Loudly.",2

These massive attacks by Russia on civilians in Sumy, in Odesa, in Kherson, in Zaporizhzhia, in Kharkiv, in Kyiv, are all proof of the inhumanity of Russia.     And, the acts of Ukrainians, like kneeling as a funeral procession passes or the Moment of Honor every morning at 9:00am, or the photographs on gravestones, show how love is part of their culture.     And I saw a video of Ukrainians women defenders making Ukrainians Easter eggs with a picture of their fallen comrade, combat medic Iryna ""Cheka"" Tsybukh, on the table.  As one defender said to me about that, ""I hope most countries could adapt the culture of love...""    All of these are proof Ukraine never was Russia. Their cultures are entirely different.
